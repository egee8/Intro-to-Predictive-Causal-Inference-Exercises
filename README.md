This repository contains my work for an introductory class I took on predictive and causal inference using R with Professor Alexis Diamond.

***Course Description***
Learn how to extract meaning from data using modern approaches such as Bayesian Inference. Armed with this
information apply the tools of decision science to solve a wide range of problems. The course focuses primarily on
applying statistical inference and formal models of decision making to design practical solutions. Students frame
and quantify a range of scenarios to address real problems in the life sciences, energy and technology industries.
Discover how to make big strategic decisions with math, statistics and simulation.

The course focuses on the application of causal and predictive statistical inference for strategic decision making
across a wide range of scenarios and contexts. Technical aspects of the course focus on computational approaches
and real-world challenges, drawing cases from the life sciences, public policy and politics, education, and business.
This course will also emphasize the importance of being able to articulate oneâ€™s findings effectively and tailor
methodology and policy/decision-relevant recommendations for different audiences
